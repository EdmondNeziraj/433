# 4-3-3
4-3-3 is a web application for amateur soccer players to come together and schedule and organize pick-up soccer games. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to browse through existing matches, and view details such as location, number of players, players who have already joined the match and their names, and any additional information provided by the host. With an account, users can join matches, host their own matches, edit or delete a match they have hosted, and keep track of all the matches they have joined or hosted.

The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS, providing a smooth and responsive user interface. The use of ReactJS allows for seamless navigation and dynamic updates to the match information, ensuring users have access to the most up-to-date information. The backend of the application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with a variety of libraries used to enhance functionality. The use of MongoDB allows for flexible and scalable storage of the users’ and matches’ data. User authentication and authorization are handled securely using the Bcrypt library to ensure the protection of users’ sensitive information.
